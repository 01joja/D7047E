# Week 19

Got the training to work for the project and verified it. It where really good. But might need to be tested one more time becouse shuffle where true. 10 h.

Finished the lab for the week. I only need to do the theory part too. 4 h.

## recent trends 

### Reinforcements learning

Watched the first [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0). It talked about the fundamental things in reinforcement learning.

It talked about the 

RL agents:

- Policy baced
- Value baced
- Actor Cretic (Both above)

Catagories of RL agents:

- Model free. Has no real model of the task only uses Policy/Value for decision.
- Model Based. Firs build a model and then from that develop a Policy/Value.

Q-learning. Look up.

The 2 different ways to approach a problem with RL:

- No model:
  - Unknown environment
  - The agent interacts with environment
  - The agent improves policy
- Planning:
  - You create a model
  - The agent interacts with the model and test things virtually

Exploration or Exploitation:

- Exploration find more information for more future reward
- Exploitation use known information for instant reward
