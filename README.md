Deep Courses on LTU

The project ADL Project Pneumonia Detection.


## How to run?

Sadly I can't scrip the download process and it's way too much data to put on github. Also our network is too big to put on github (500 MB). 

Follow these steps and it should work:

1. Download train, test and val from this [link](https://ltu.app.box.com/s/ywboito9frcx5w4c4mzrrrl4qf2rh9u3)
2. Create a folder named "dataset" in the same folder as this file is.
3. Unzip train, test, and val there.
4. Move all things in dataset/val/NORMAL to dataset/train/NORMAL
5. Move all things in dataset/val/PNEUMONIA dataset/train/PNEUMONIA
6. Run train.py
7. Run checkCorrectness.py
